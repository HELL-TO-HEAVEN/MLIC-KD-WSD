## This is the caffe in which our implementation for MLIC-KD-WSD is merged.  

#### Implementation details
        ./caffe
            include
                ...
            src
                caffe
                    layers
                        cross_entropy_loss_layer.cpp        // cross entropy loss for WSDDN
                        human_att_data_layer.cpp            // data layer
                        interp_layer.cpp                    // bilinear interpolation
                        roi_pooling_layer.cpp/cu            // add score
                        wsd_roigen_layer.cpp                // prepare rois for roi pooling
                        wsd_roigen_single_scale_layer.cpp   // convert rois' coordinates according to the given scale
                    proto
                        caffe.proto (line 407-471)          // add some LayerParameters 
                    utils
                        interp.cpp/cu                       // bilinear interpolation
                    data_transformer.cpp (line 41-160)      // data augmentation  

The code has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 14.04 with CUDA 8.0, cuDNN 5.1 and OpenCV 3.1.0.
